                 Soft or hardware
                Stops unauthorized access, blocks unwanted traffic
                ACL - access control list (allowed IP addresses) (or ports)
                Rule IPLICID DENY

                HOST BASED firewall
                PC has software firewall - Windows Firewall
                NETWORK BASED firewall

                Stateful (through-record) vs stateless (not through, uses acl and no record)

                Content filter

                Signature identification (spots virus behaviour)

Network components
  Docsis (modem) - data ofver cable 10Gigabit downstream and 1 Gigabit upstream
  Hub (not intelegent) eathernet conection from network devices (active with power vs passive no power)
  Switch (inellegetn) learns physical addresses (switches reduce traffic on network)
  l2
  multilayer switch l2, l3
  content switch l4-l7
  Po–ï Power over ethernet
    Spanning Tree protocol (avoid trafic loops)
  Bridges (filters based on mac addresss)
  routers (based on ip)
  gateway (connects netowrk with different formats + doesn't change data)
  csu/dsu (local to WAN)
  NICs - netork interface card (every nic has Mac addresss  - converts serial data to parallel data
  Transceivers - wireles
  WAP wireless access point
  Modem (telephone lines) analog to digital 56kbps
  
  Wireless
      5 standards
      a,b,g,n,ac (speedd, frequeency released
      Infrared - data transmitted in rays of light
      (reuires a direct lne of sight, direct sunlight
      Bluetooth2.4Ghz - 24mbps 100m

      MAC ADDRESS (media access control)
      numbers + a-f
      address = manufactureer (netgear + unique number)

  Protocols   
     
     TCP (transmission control prot.)
     3 hadshake SYN, SYN AKN, AKN
     
     UDP (user datagram prot.)
     no garantees, but quick
     
     FTP (file transfer protocol)
     conneciton orienteed, uses tcp for file transfer,     (security shell)
     
     TFTP  (trivial file trnafer protocol)
     for the same network
     
     SMTP (send meil to people) 
     emails, uses tcp
     
     POP3 
     recieving emails, downloads emails, email removed
     
     IMAP4 (internet message access protocol)
     better

DNS
("phonebook analogy")
WINS
NAT (network translation for networks) used by routers, translates bunch of ip to ips (to public)
PAT (port address trnslation)
SNAT (static nat) does translation of ip permanently
Proxy servis (speed, bandwidth, security)
RDP (remote desktop protocol)
CSAMA/CD - collision protocol
CSMA/CA
Broadcast
Unicast vs Multicast (data packets send to multiple destinations)
