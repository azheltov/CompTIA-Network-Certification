                 Soft or hardware
                Stops unauthorized access, blocks unwanted traffic
                ACL - access control list (allowed IP addresses) (or ports)
                Rule IPLICID DENY

                HOST BASED firewall
                PC has software firewall - Windows Firewall
                NETWORK BASED firewall

                Stateful (through-record) vs stateless (not through, uses acl and no record)

                Content filter

                Signature identification (spots virus behaviour)

                IDS/IPS (hardware) - viruses, malware, hackers

Network components
  Docsis (modem) - data ofver cable 10Gigabit downstream and 1 Gigabit upstream
  Hub (not intelegent) eathernet conection from network devices (active with power vs passive no power)
  Switch (inellegetn) learns physical addresses (switches reduce traffic on network)
  l2
  multilayer switch l2, l3
  content switch l4-l7
  Po–ï Power over ethernet
    Spanning Tree protocol (avoid trafic loops)
